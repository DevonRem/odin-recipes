    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Having eggs Benedict for brunch feels like a special occasion not only because it's a luxurious dish, but also because it's one of those things you might be too intimidated to make at home. I mean, you can handle toasting an English muffin and sautéing Canadian bacon. But poaching an egg? Whipping up silky smooth Hollandaise sauce? That's where many of us bail out. But master those two major building blocks of eggs Benedict, and you're golden.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>eggs</li>
        <li>Hollandaise sauce</li>
        <li>Muffin</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Split and toast English muffins. Spread with softened butter.</li>
        <li>Top each half with a slice of lightly sautéed Canadian bacon.</li>
        <li>Reheat two poached eggs by placing them in simmering water for a couple of seconds. Place one on each muffin half.</li>
        <li>Top each half with Hollandaise sauce. (If the sauce has cooled, you can reheat it by placing it over a saucepan of simmering water and whisking until it warms up.)</li>
        <li>Garnish with dill, chives, or any minced herb of your choice.</li>
    </ol>
